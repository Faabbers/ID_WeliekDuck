# ID_WeliekDuck
This website is created to increase the overall interest in users when shopping for shoes. As a concept, users will be able to log in daily in order to earn rewards and vouchers. There will also be giveaways, and a chat forum available for shoe enthusiasts to chat their hearts away! 
Some other features that we would add would be to add in a Google Maps API in order to locate nearby stores which have the specific shoe that users would like to purchase. There will also be a like system that would work together with a sorting system to allow users to sort the shoes by certain filters. 
In this website, we have mainly used html, css and javascript. 
The website is screen responsive and should work on either phone or laptops/monitors. 
The website currently only has Nike shoes.
